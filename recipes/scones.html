        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe comes from the King Arthur Baking website. I have made it a number of times and it is delicious!</p>
        <p>Who doesn't love bacon? Adding in some sharp cheddar, and the chive (or green onion) flavor, makes for a delicous, flaky savory treat!</p>

            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups All Purpose or Pastry Flour</li>
                    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp baking poweder</li>
                    <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
                    <li>4 tbsp cold butter</li>
                    <li>1 cup coarsely grated or diced cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup snipped fresh chives or finely diced scallion tops (the green part only)</li>
                    <li>1/2 lb. bacon- cooked, cooled & crumbled</li>
                    <li>3/4 + 2 tbsp heavy or whipping cream, or enough to make the dough cohesive</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425Â°F with a rack in the middle to upper third. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.</li>
                    <li>Whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly, with some of the butter remaining in larger pieces.</li>
                    <li>Mix in the cheese, chives, and bacon until evenly distributed.</li>
                    <li>Add 3/4 cup of the cream, stirring to combine. Try squeezing the dough together; if it's crumbly and won't hang together, or if there are crumbs remaining in the bottom of the bowl, add cream until the dough comes together. Transfer the shaggy dough to a well-floured work surface.</li>
                    <li>Pat the dough into a smooth 7" disk about 3/4" thick. Transfer the disk to the prepared baking sheet. Use a knife or bench knife to cut the disk into 8 wedges, spreading the wedges apart a bit on the pan.</li>
                    <li>Brush the scones with a bit of cream; this will help their crust brown.</li>
                    <li>Bake the scones in the middle or upper third of the oven for 22 to 24 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. Serve warm, or at room temperature.</li>
                    <li>Refrigerate any leftover scones, well wrapped, for several days; reheat before serving. Freeze for longer storage.</li>

                </ol>
