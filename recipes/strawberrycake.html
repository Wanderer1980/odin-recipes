        <h4>Ingredients</h4>

                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing</li>
                <li>5 oz. frozen (thawed) or fresh hulled strawberries (about 1 cup)</li>
                <li>2/3 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup whole milk, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>Vanilla ice cream (optional, for serving)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oven to 350 degrees and grease an 8-inch (square or round) baking dish with butter. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Using your hands or the back of a fork, mash the berries to release all their juices, and stir in 1/3 cup of the brown sugar. Set aside.</li>
                <li>n a medium bowl, whisk together the melted butter, remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar, milk and salt, then add the flour and baking powder and continue whisking just until the batter is smooth. Transfer the batter (itâ€™s not much) to the greased baking dish, and spread evenly into corners.</li>
                <li>Spoon the strawberries and all their juices over the top of the cake batter. Place in the oven and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or just when a toothpick comes out clean in the center. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 3 to 5 minutes before spooning into bowls. Serve warm with ice cream.</li>
            </ol>
